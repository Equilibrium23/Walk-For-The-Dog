## App Description
Walk For The Dog Is a web app that allows people to help other people in difficult times.
When you're on quarantine and can't take a dog for a walk someone can help you with it.
Just create your account, load your location, the app will show you a list of users in your neighborhood (selected distance by every user) with their free time and allow you to contact with them. 
## User Stories
#### Our app is created for two types of users :
  - #####  user A - person who needs help
  - ##### user B - person who provides help<br/><br/>

- As user A I want to register to the app to find someone willing to walk my dog
during quarantine.
- As user A I would like to choose my location and see all the possible helpers
in my vicinity from which I can choose the most suitable option for me.
- As user A I would like to get a notification in the app and my e-mail, if there is
someone who can help me.
- As user A I want to be able to upload my dog’s picture, write down important
things about my pet and its behaviour.
- As user A I want to add a comment on the user’s B profile after walking the
dog.
- As user A/B I want to chat in the app with user B/A to discuss the details of
walking the dog.
- As user A and B I want to connect with my (google) calendar or write my
spare time manually.
- As user B I want to register to the app to help someone walk their dog during
quarantine.
- As user B I would like to choose my location and choose the area in which I
